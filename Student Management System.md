# Student Management System üìù
![student-management-system](https://github.com/zahariev-webbersof/python-fundamentals-05-2024/assets/68993494/746ccfd8-f414-4714-96f9-e9d704cce587)

The goal of this project is to create a simple student management system using Python. This system will allow users to add, update, delete, and search for student records. Each student record will include information such as name, age, grade, and subjects. 
This project will give students practical experience with strings, integers, floats, booleans, lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

## ‚úÖ Project Requirements

- Data Types and Variables

- Understand and use different data types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
Tasks to Implement

- Add Student:
Create a function to add a new student record. Each record should include the student's name (string), age (int), grade (float), and subjects (list of strings).
- Update Student:
Create a function to update an existing student record. Allow updating of any of the fields (name, age, grade, subjects).
- Delete Student:
Create a function to delete a student record based on the student's name.
- Search Student:
Create a function to search for a student by name and return their record.
- List All Students:
Create a function to list all student records.

## ‚úÖ Documentation and Comments

Include comments explaining each function and its purpose.
Provide documentation strings for each function, describing the parameters and return values.
User Interaction

Create a main program that prompts the user to choose which task they want to perform.
Use input prompts to gather the necessary data from the user.
Display the results of the chosen task in a clear and user-friendly manner.

### Now, let's write the code for this project:

## ‚úÖ Additional Notes for Students
- Comments: Follow the comments and implement the necessary logic in each function.
- Error Handling: Add error handling where appropriate, such as checking for the existence of a student record before attempting to update or delete it.
- User Interaction: Ensure that user prompts and outputs are clear and user-friendly.
- Data Validation: Validate inputs where necessary (e.g., ensure age is an integer, grade is a float, etc.).


This skeleton provides the structure and necessary functions for the student management system. Your task is to complete the implementation by writing the code for each function according to the provided comments and requirements.
